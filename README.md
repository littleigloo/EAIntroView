## Installation

Use `Swift Package Manager` to install.

## How To Use It

Sample project have many examples of customization. Here are only simple ones.

### Step 1 - Build Pages
Each page created with `[EAIntroPage page]` class method. Then you can customize any property, all of them are optional. Another approach is to pass your own (can be nib), custom view in `EAIntroPage`, this way most other options are ignored.

```objc
// basic
EAIntroPage *page1 = [EAIntroPage page];
page1.title = @"Hello world";
page1.desc = sampleDescription1;
// custom
EAIntroPage *page2 = [EAIntroPage page];
page2.title = @"This is page 2";
page2.titleFont = [UIFont fontWithName:@"Georgia-BoldItalic" size:20];
page2.titlePositionY = 220;
page2.desc = sampleDescription2;
page2.descFont = [UIFont fontWithName:@"Georgia-Italic" size:18];
page2.descPositionY = 200;
page2.titleIconView = [[UIImageView alloc] initWithImage:[UIImage imageNamed:@"title2"]];
page2.titleIconPositionY = 100;
// custom view from nib
EAIntroPage *page3 = [EAIntroPage pageWithCustomViewFromNibNamed:@"IntroPage"];
page3.bgImage = [UIImage imageNamed:@"bg2"];
```

### Step 2 - Create Introduction View
Once all pages have been created,  you are ready to create the introduction view. Just pass them in right order in the introduction view. You can also pass array of pages after IntroView's initialization, it will rebuild its contents.

```objc
EAIntroView *intro = [[EAIntroView alloc] initWithFrame:self.view.bounds andPages:@[page1,page2,page3,page4]];
```

Don't forget to set the delegate if you want to use any callbacks.

```objc
[intro setDelegate:self];
```

### Step 3 - Show Introduction View

```objc
[intro showInView:self.view animateDuration:0.0];
```

### Storyboard/IB
Since 1.3.0 `EAIntroView` supports init from IB. Since 2.0.0 `EAIntroPage` supports it too.

1. Drop `UIView` to your IB document.
2. Set its class to `EAIntroView`.
3. Create `IBOutlet` property in your view controller: `@property(nonatomic,weak) IBOutlet EAIntroView *introView;`.
4. Connect `IBOutlet` with `EAIntroView` in IB.
5. Build array of pages (you can use `pageWithCustomViewFromNibNamed:` here with separate nibs for each page).
6. Pass pages array to `EAIntroView` property in `setPages:`.
